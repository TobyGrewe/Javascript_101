strings
In JavaScript, when we surround a word with quotes it's called a string, and when we're done with a line of code we finish it with a semicolon.

functions
JavaScript also has built-in features, called functions. In order to call a function, we simply write its name (this time without quotes) and end it with a set of parentheses. Try calling the alert function as you see below.

string function paramteter
Well, many functions (like the alert function) can take instructions, which we call parameters. By sending a string into the alert function, we can put text on the pop-up box. Try it!

variables 
Often when programming we want to store values in containers so we can use them later; these are called variables. Let’s store your name in a variable, or ‘var’ for short, by typing the following:
var firstName = "toby";

type firstName and you get toby

Numbers
1 vaule type (strings) but JS has many! Another example of a value type is a number.Just like a function, a number does not get quotations.

Combining Numbers
we can also do math in JS

14+28;

Combining strings
JS can also combine strings
create an alert tat combines your name and a string
alert(firstName + " is awesome!");
